Weird Scrambled PDF Content:The downloaded PDF content appears scrambled, showing characters like "Ã​Â" instead of the expected text from the webpage.

Encoding Issue:** The encoding problem seems to be causing the scrambled text in the PDF. The webpage content is not being encoded correctly when creating the PDF.

Automatic Download:** You want the PDF to be downloaded automatically without having to click a link. The current solution requires a manual click to initiate the download.

File Saving Location:** The downloaded PDF is saved in the project directory. You might want to specify a different location or provide an option for the user to choose the download location.

Styling:The `index.html` file could be improved for better aesthetics and readability.

Code Structure:** The Python code in `scraper.py` and `app.py` might benefit from slight modifications for better clarity.
